- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance affects programming because we don't have to start from scratch with everything! It would take a lot longer to create a cafe, house, and library if we had to define what a building is all over again, but by using the Building superconstructor we save a lot of time. All we have to do is instead define what differentiates each of these classes from the Building class, instead of creating an entirely new class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The biggest thing I struggled with was using hashtables in the Library class and utilizing its methods, so I would say to someone taking this course in the future to make sure you understand the data structures you are using fully before trying to implement them.
